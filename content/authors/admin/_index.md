I'm Astrid, a teaching assistant at the <a href="https://www.usaintlouis.be">UClouvain Saint-Louis - Bruxelles</a>. I graduated with honors from a Master in Economics at the UCLouvain in 2020. During my Master, I participated in the Erasmus+ Program for one semester at the Bocconi University in Milan. 
 
My research interests is public economics and more precisely mobility and its impacts on the population. 

I am a member of the <a href="https://beamm.brussels/">Beamm</a>  project an effort to build an online open-acces comprehensive tax-benefit microsimulation model for Belgium.
I also have experience in spending reviews, which is a growing field in government budget management.
